# Shape Area Calculation Program

## Overview

This PHP program defines an abstract class `Shape` and two subclasses, `Circle` and `Rectangle`, to calculate the area of different shapes. It demonstrates the use of abstract classes and method overriding in object-oriented programming.

## Features

- Defines an abstract class `Shape` with an abstract method `calculateArea()`.
- Implements the `Circle` class to calculate the area of a circle.
- Implements the `Rectangle` class to calculate the area of a rectangle.
- Displays the calculated areas of the shapes in a formatted manner.
