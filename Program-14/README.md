# Math Operations Program

## Overview

This PHP program defines a `MathOperations` class that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication using the magic method `__call`. This allows for dynamic method handling based on the method name invoked.

## Features

- Implements a `MathOperations` class with dynamic method handling.
- Supports addition, subtraction, and multiplication of multiple numbers.
- Displays the results of the operations in a readable format.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

   You can clone this repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FenilGalani07/Laravel-Assignment-2.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd Laravel-Assignment-2
   ```

3. **Run the PHP Script**

   Make sure you have a local server environment set up (like XAMPP or WAMP). Place the files in the server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).

   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/Math_operations.php` to access the math operations program.

## Example Output

The program performs the following operations:

```php
Addition: 10
Subtraction: 5
Multiplication: 24
```

Where:
- **Addition** is calculated as `1 + 2 + 3 + 4`
- **Subtraction** is calculated as `10 - 2 - 3`
- **Multiplication** is calculated as `2 * 3 * 4`
