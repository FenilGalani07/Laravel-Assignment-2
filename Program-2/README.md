# Palindrome Checker

## Overview

This is a simple PHP program that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

## Features

- Cleans the input string by removing non-alphanumeric characters.
- Converts the string to lowercase for accurate comparison.
- Checks if the cleaned string is the same when reversed.
