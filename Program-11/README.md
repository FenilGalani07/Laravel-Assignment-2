# Visit Count Program

## Overview

This PHP program tracks the number of times a user has visited a specific page using cookies. Each time the user visits the page, the visit count is incremented and displayed.

## Features

- Uses cookies to store the visit count for one day.
- Displays the number of times the user has visited the page.
- Increments the visit count each time the page is refreshed.
